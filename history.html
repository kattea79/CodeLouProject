            <p>How did this begin you ask (and if not why are you still reading this page)...well read on!</p>
            <br/>
          <h5 id="panelHeading">The Womb and Early Years</h5>
            <p>Moonpie was the runt which left her always fighting for space in the womb encircled by her 6 siblings, the nearest of which was Mini.
            The sisters spent their time cuddling, mewing, and batting at others tails.</p>
            <p></p>Things were going well with the new family until an ill fated vacation. After hopping a train from Dallas to Mexico, 
            the sisters were tousling and rolled right out of an open train car in Austin. This eventually led to a kill shelter where luckily a kind soul saved and fostered them.</p>

          <h5 id="panelHeading">Foster Care</h5>
            <p>During their time in foster care Moonpie and Mini were surrounded by battle (along with 2 humans, 5 dogs and 4 other cats).  
            Aggressions were high leaving Moonpie to find every nook and cranny to shove herself into at a moment's notice. 
            Being the social butterfly Mini more easily adapted using her friendliness to gain allies.</p>
            <p>Although Moonpie was happy for her sister's social growth she was jealous and missed their close relationship. Mini, who also missed her sister spent the first few months of foster care trying to coax Moonpie out of hiding and comfort her. 
            Eventually frustration arose and Mini gave up in hopes that Moonpie would gain confidence and join her with her new friends.</p>

          <h5 id="panelHeading">Permanent Home</h5>
            <p>Finally the duo found a permanent home with Tracy and John (the Bystanders).  Upon their arrival Moonpie hid while Mini slowly began to make friends. Initially the Bystanders showered affection on Mini while giving Moonpie her space. 
            Over the next few weeks and months as Mini became completely comfortable in her new home, the Bystanders spent progressively more time coaxing Moonpie out of hiding.  This caused jealousy to spike in Mini who had gotten used to ruling the roost. 
            Moonpie had still not gotten over her anger and feelings of abandonment from her foster home and enjoyed being the center of attention for a while.</p>
            <p>By the time the Bystanders recognized the hostility brewing, it was too late....the war had begun and could not be quelled.</p>
